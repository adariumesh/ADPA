# Executive Summary & Introduction

## Project Overview

The Autonomous Data Pipeline Agent (ADPA) is a course project for DATA650 that demonstrates automated machine learning pipeline management using AWS cloud services. The system aims to reduce manual intervention in ML pipeline creation through intelligent planning, cloud-native execution, and comprehensive monitoring.

**Demonstration Use Case**: Retail sales forecasting pipeline that automatically processes sales data, performs cleaning and feature engineering, and provides performance monitoring.

# Current Challenges & Next Steps

## Technical Challenges Encountered

### Dependency Management
**Challenge**: Developing monitoring systems without requiring full AWS setup for testing.  
**Solution**: Implemented mock-first approach allowing development and testing without external dependencies.

### Service Integration Complexity
**Challenge**: Coordinating multiple AWS services with proper permissions and event handling.  
**Solution**: Used CDK infrastructure-as-code with comprehensive IAM role management.

# Conclusion & Timeline

## Progress Assessment

The ADPA project has successfully demonstrated significant technical achievements across cloud infrastructure, monitoring, and API development. Each team member has delivered production-ready components that work independently and are ready for integration.

**Major Accomplishments**:
- **Complete AWS Infrastructure**: Production deployment with all necessary services
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Enterprise-grade observability across multiple dimensions  
- **Secure API Foundation**: Authentication and deployment infrastructure ready
- **Proof of Concept**: All core concepts validated through working implementations

## Current Limitations

- **Agent Integration**: Core agent components require integration work to achieve full autonomy
- **End-to-End Flow**: Individual components need orchestration for complete pipeline execution
- **Limited ML Models**: Focus has been on infrastructure rather than advanced ML algorithms
- **Demo Scope**: Current scope suitable for course demonstration rather than production deployment

## Timeline for Course Completion

```{r timeline}
timeline_data <- data.frame(
  Week = c("Week 1", "Week 2", "Final Week"),

  column_spec(4, width = "5cm")
```

## Course Demonstration Plan

**Final Demo Scope**: Autonomous creation and execution of a retail sales forecasting pipeline demonstrating:
1. Intelligent data analysis and preprocessing planning
2. Automated ETL execution with AWS Glue
3. Real-time monitoring with anomaly detection  
4. Performance analytics and optimization recommendations

The project successfully validates the core concepts of autonomous ML pipeline management while providing a solid technical foundation for future enhancement and real-world application.
