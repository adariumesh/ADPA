# ADPA Documentation Index

Every Markdown document for the project now resides under `docs/`, so you can browse this folder (and its subdirectories) to find anything from deployment guides to retrospective reports. The summarized READMEs remain under `docs/readmes/` for quick navigation:

| Area | File |
| ---- | ---- |
| Project overview | `docs/readmes/README_main.md` |
| Frontend app | `docs/readmes/README_frontend.md` |
| Infrastructure/IaC | `docs/readmes/README_infrastructure.md` |
| MCP server | `docs/readmes/README_mcp_server.md` |

> Tip: keep this directory up to date whenever new READMEs are added so everything stays centralized.
