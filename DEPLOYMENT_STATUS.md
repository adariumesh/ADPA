# ADPA Lambda Deployment Status Report

**Timestamp**: 2025-12-12  
**Target Function**: `adpa-data-processor-development`  
**Region**: `us-east-2`  
**Status**: ✅ **Live & Healthy**

> ### Latest Update — 2025-12-12
> - Rebuilt the `adpa-ml-dependencies-clean` Lambda layer (v4) with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and SciPy while trimming non-runtime assets to stay under the 250 MB unzipped limit.
> - Redeployed the Lambda handler package (`adpa-deployment-code.zip`) with the new SageMaker trainer + entrypoint logic.
> - Verified the function via direct `health_check` invocation — result `"status": "healthy"` (imports/agent/monitoring all `true`).
> - Added lightweight SciPy compatibility shims for future local runs; production now uses the rebuilt layer with real binaries.

Historical context for the original manual-deployment guidance is preserved below.

## Issue Summary

The deployment process encountered **persistent shell environment issues** that prevent direct execution of bash commands. This is likely due to a missing or corrupted shell snapshot file in the temporary directory system.

**Error Pattern**:
```
zsh:source:1: no such file or directory: /var/folders/l0/wnr6fgvj3g13n6wb9w7s6wxh0000gn/T/claude-shell-snapshot-7eeb
```

## Workaround Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Manual Deployment Scripts ✅

- **`deployment_instructions.md`**: Complete step-by-step manual deployment guide
- **`boto3_deploy.py`**: Pure Python deployment script using boto3 (no shell dependencies)  
- **`lambda_package_creator.py`**: Package creation utility
- **`deployment_manifest.json`**: Deployment configuration manifest

### 2. Deployment Package Preparation ✅

## Deployment Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Source Code | ✅ Ready | Complete ADPA implementation available |
| Lambda Handler | ✅ Ready | `lambda_function.py` configured |
| Configuration | ✅ Ready | `config/default_config.yaml` available |
| Dependencies | ✅ Ready | Requirements defined |
| Package Scripts | ✅ Ready | Multiple deployment methods created |
| Shell Execution | ❌ Failed | Environment issue prevents bash commands |

## Next Steps for Deployment

### Option 1: Execute boto3_deploy.py (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/adariprasad/weapon/UMD/DATA650/Group\ Presentation/adpa

# Run Python deployment script (bypasses shell issues)
python3 boto3_deploy.py
```

### Option 2: Manual AWS CLI Commands

1. **Create Package**:
   ```bash
   python3 lambda_package_creator.py
   ```

2. **Deploy with AWS CLI**:
   ```bash
   aws lambda update-function-code \
       --function-name adpa-data-processor-development \
       --zip-file fileb://adpa-lambda-deployment.zip \
       --region us-east-2
   ```

3. **Test Deployment**:
   ```bash
   aws lambda invoke \
       --function-name adpa-data-processor-development \
       --payload '{"action": "health_check"}' \
       --region us-east-2 \
       response.json
   ```

### Option 3: AWS Console Upload

1. Create package using `python3 lambda_package_creator.py`
2. Upload `adpa-lambda-deployment.zip` via AWS Lambda Console
3. Configure environment variables manually

  "components": {
    "imports": true,
    "monitoring": true, 
    "kpi_tracker": true,
    "agent": true
  },
  "aws_config": {
    "data_bucket": "adpa-data-276983626136-development",
    "model_bucket": "adpa-models-276983626136-development",
    "region": "us-east-2"

```json
{
  "action": "run_pipeline",
  "dataset_path": "s3://adpa-data-276983626136-development/test.csv",
  "objective": "classification"
}
```

## Monitoring Setup

After deployment, monitor via:

1. **CloudWatch Logs**: `/aws/lambda/adpa-data-processor-development`
2. **CloudWatch Metrics**: Custom ADPA metrics
3. **Dashboard**: ADPA Performance Dashboard
4. **Alarms**: Critical failure notifications

## File Deliverables

### Created Files:
1. ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Manual deployment guide
2. ✅ `boto3_deploy.py` - Python-based deployment script  
3. ✅ `lambda_package_creator.py` - Package creation utility
4. ✅ `deployment_manifest.json` - Configuration manifest
5. ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - This status report

### Shell Scripts (Available but not executable):
- `deploy/deploy_lambda.sh` - Original bash deployment script
- `manual_deploy.py` - Alternative Python deployment approach

## Recommendations

1. **Execute `boto3_deploy.py`** as the primary deployment method
2. **Verify AWS credentials** are properly configured
3. **Test connectivity** to target Lambda function before deployment  
4. **Monitor CloudWatch logs** during and after deployment
5. **Run validation tests** after successful deployment
